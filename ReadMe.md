This is fork from UberGuido'z repo. I removed some unused and add some usefull files


## How to use files?

1. Download repository as .zip
2. Unpack archive in your computer
3. Copy all files from archive to SD card of your flipper (it is better to put SD card directly into computer - it is faster)
4. Enjoy!
